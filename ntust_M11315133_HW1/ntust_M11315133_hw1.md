## Implementation

* Based on the original `vecAdd.cu`, I modified the device code as follows to implement the computation:

```c
__global__ void compute(float* A, float* B, float* C, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n && j < n) {
        int idx = i * n + j;
        C[idx] = 1.0f / A[idx] + 1.0f / B[idx];
    }
}
```

* In the main function, a loop is used to test different block sizes from 1 to 32. For each block size, the program executes the kernel 10 times, calculates the average execution time, and logs the results into `result.csv` for later analysis.

```c
for (int tpb = 1; tpb <= 32; ++tpb) {
    dim3 blockDim(tpb, tpb);
    dim3 gridDim((N + tpb - 1) / tpb, (N + tpb - 1) / tpb);

    float totalTime = 0.0f;

    // Repeat the measurement multiple times for averaging
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_REPEATS; ++i) {
        // call `compute` and sum up the total execution time
    }

    float avgTime = totalTime / NUM_REPEATS;
    float gflops = (2.0f * N * N / 1e9f) / (avgTime / 1000.0f);
}
```

## Analysis

### Result

* After submitting the task using `condor_submit cmd` and running the experiment, the performance data was collected into `result.csv`, containing GFLOPS values for different thread block sizes. The results were visualized using `plot_result.py` with matplotlib.

The plot below shows the GPU performance (in GFLOPS) as a function of threads per block:

### Observation
* From the graph, we can observe that:

	* The performance rapidly increases from 1 thread per block and reaches a stable high performance around 13–32 threads per block.

	* The maximum GFLOPS achieved is **approximately 69376.70 (block size = 13)**.
	
This indicates that the majority of configurations perform close to the upper performance bound, with a few outliers (like the case with 1 thread per block) pulling the mean slightly lower than the median.
